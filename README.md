# amino

Amino acids ontology developed using the original ontology developed by Phillip Lord with Tawny-OWL library <http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/phillip.lord/take-wing/take_wing.html>. In this development I use an Excel spreadsheet as a source of information for the amino acids values. In addition, the ontology is written in a narrative style to generate the form of "literate ontology".
